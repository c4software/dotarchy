The configuration for Hyprland is located in archlinux/install/hyprland/config/hypr.\nStructure # The configuration is split into multiple files for better organization:\nhyprland.conf: The main configuration file that sources all other configuration files. autostart.conf: Manages applications and scripts that are launched at startup. bindings.conf: Defines all keybindings and mouse bindings for window management, application launching, and system controls. envs.conf: Sets environment variables used by Hyprland and other applications. input.conf: Configures input devices such as keyboards, mice, and touchpads. monitors.conf: Defines monitor layouts, resolutions, and refresh rates. base/: This directory contains the core configuration files for different aspects of the compositor: apps.conf: Window rules for specific applications. autostart.conf: Core startup applications. bindings.conf: Base keybindings. envs.conf: Essential environment variables. hyprlock.conf: Configuration for the screen locker. input.conf: General input settings. looknfeel.conf: Visual settings like gaps, borders, and animations. sidepad.conf: Configuration for side panels or special devices. windows.conf: General window management rules. Themes # The look and feel of Hyprland, including colors and styles for other applications like Waybar and Alacritty, are managed through themes located in archlinux/install/hyprland/config/themes. Each theme has its own directory containing specific configuration files.\nScripts # A collection of useful scripts is available in archlinux/install/hyprland/bin. These scripts handle tasks like taking screenshots, managing power profiles, launching menus, and controlling system settings.\nKeybindings # Keybindings are defined in the bindings.conf file. This file includes shortcuts for launching applications, managing windows, and controlling system functions. The configuration uses a combination of modifier keys (like SUPER, ALT, and CTRL) and other keys to create a comprehensive set of shortcuts.\nFor a complete list of keybindings and their functions, refer to the official Hyprland documentation on keybindings.\nThere is some example content in the bindings.conf file:\n# Launch terminal bind = SUPER,RETURN,exec,uwsm app -- alacritty # Close focused window bind = SUPER,Q,close # Switch to workspace 1 bind = SUPER,1,workspace,1 # Move focused window to workspace 2 bind = SUPER,SHIFT,2,movetoworkspace,2 # Toggle floating mode for focused window bind = SUPER,F,modetoggle,floating Autostart # The autostart.conf file is used to launch applications and scripts automatically when Hyprland starts. This is useful for starting essential services like the notification daemon, the status bar, or the wallpaper manager.\nFor more details, you can refer to the official documentation on executing applications.\nHere is an example from the configuration:\n# Start the notification daemon exec-once = uwsm app -- mako # Start the status bar exec-once = uwsm app -- waybar # Set a random background exec-once = uwsm app -- dotarchy-random-bg Environment Variables # The envs.conf file allows you to set environment variables that will be available within the Hyprland session. This is useful for configuring applications that rely on environment variables for their behavior.\nFor more information, see the official documentation on environment variables.\nExample:\n# Set cursor size env = XCURSOR_SIZE,24 env = HYPRCURSOR_SIZE,24 Input Devices # The input.conf file is where you configure your input devices, such as keyboards, mice, and touchpads. You can set options like keyboard layout, mouse sensitivity, and touchpad gestures.\nConsult the official documentation on input configuration for a complete list of options.\nMonitors # The monitors.conf file is used to define the layout, resolution, and refresh rate of your monitors. This is essential for multi-monitor setups.\nFor detailed configuration options, visit the official documentation on configuring monitors.\nOr use the dotarchy-monitor-resolution-picker or hyprmon tools to help set up your monitors.
