## Themes

The visual theme is a core part of the Dotarchy experience. Themes are managed in a centralized way and applied to multiple applications. The main theme configuration can be found in `common/config/theme`.

For example, `alacritty.toml` in this directory defines the color scheme for the Alacritty terminal emulator.

## Fonts

A selection of fonts is installed to ensure a consistent and pleasant visual experience, especially for development. These are listed in `archlinux/install/desktop/packages.aur.txt` and include:

- `ttf-cascadia-mono-nerd`
- `ttf-ia-writer`
- `ttf-jetbrains-mono`
- `noto-fonts` (including emoji and CJK)
